# FRONTEND ENGINEERING ROLE - INTERVIEW QUESTIONS.

### Q1. Can you explain how the box model works in CSS?

>In CSS, every HTML element is considered as a rectangular box, also known as the box model. The box model consists of four components: content, padding, border, and margin. Let's look at each of these components in more detail:
>* **1. Content:** This is the actual content of the element, such as text, images, or videos.
>* **2. Padding:** This is the space between the content and the border. Padding is used to create extra space inside the element and is defined using the padding property in CSS.
>* **3. Border:** This is a line that surrounds the element's content and padding. The border is defined using the border property in CSS and can have a thickness, color, and style.
>* **4. Margin:** This is the space between the border and the adjacent elements. Margin is used to create extra space outside the element and is defined using the margin property in CSS.

> The width and height of an element are calculated based on the content, padding, and border. For example, if an element has a width of 200 pixels and a padding of 20 pixels, then the actual content will only have a width of 160 pixels (200 pixels - 2 * 20 pixels). The margin is not included in the width and height of the element.

>It's important to understand the box model in CSS because it affects how elements are positioned and how their dimensions are calculated. By adjusting the padding, border, and margin properties, you can control the space around and within elements on a web page.


### Q2. How do you optimize website performance?

> **1. Minimize HTTP requests:** Reducing the number of HTTP requests made by the browser can significantly improve website performance. You can achieve this by combining and minifying CSS and JavaScript files, reducing the number of images on a page, and using CSS sprites.

> **2. Enable caching:** Caching allows the browser to store files from your website on the user's computer, so they don't need to be downloaded every time the user visits your site. You can use HTTP caching headers to control how long files are cached.

> **3. Use a content delivery network (CDN):** A CDN can distribute your website's content across multiple servers around the world, reducing the distance between the user and the server, and improving website speed.

> **4. Optimize images:** Large images can slow down website performance. You can reduce the size of images by compressing them or using appropriate image formats (such as JPEG for photographs and PNG for graphics with transparent backgrounds).

> **5. Minimize server response time:** The server response time is the time it takes for the server to respond to a request. You can minimize this time by optimizing database queries, minimizing HTTP requests, and using a fast hosting provider.

> **6. Reduce page weight:** Page weight refers to the total size of a page, including all files and resources. You can reduce page weight by removing unnecessary files and resources, compressing files, and optimizing code.

> **7. Use asynchronous loading:** Asynchronous loading allows your website to load resources in the background, without blocking other resources from loading. This can significantly improve website speed and performance.

### Q3. Can you describe how you would implement responsive design on a website?

> **1. Use a responsive framework or library:** There are many frameworks and libraries available that provide pre-built responsive layouts and components. Some popular options include Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize. These frameworks can save a lot of time and effort in building responsive websites.

> **2. Use CSS media queries:** CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles to an element based on the screen size. You can use media queries to adjust the layout, font size, and other design elements for different screen sizes. For example, you might define styles for screens larger than 1200 pixels wide, screens between 768 and 1199 pixels wide, and screens smaller than 768 pixels wide.

> **3. Use flexible or fluid grids:** Instead of using fixed widths for columns and elements, use flexible or fluid grids that adjust their size based on the screen size. This can be achieved using percentage-based widths or using CSS frameworks like Flexbox or CSS Grid.

> **4. Use images and videos that are optimized for different screen sizes:** Large images and videos can slow down website performance on mobile devices. To optimize images and videos for different screen sizes, use responsive images or video players that adjust the size and resolution based on the screen size.

> **5. Test on different devices:** Test your website on different devices to ensure it looks and functions correctly on all screen sizes. You can use tools like BrowserStack or Responsinator to test your website on different devices and screen sizes.

### Q10. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.
### Q11. Write a function that takes in an array of numbers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the array.
### Q12. Implement a function that takes in a string and returns the number of vowels in the string.
### Q13. Write a program that generates a multiplication table for a given number up to a specified limit. For example, if the input is 3 and 5, the output should be:

```Javascript
3 x 1 = 3
3 x 2 = 6
3 x 3 = 9
3 x 4 = 12
3 x 5 = 15

```
### Q14. Given an array of objects with `name` and `age` properties, write a function that returns the name of the oldest person in the array.
### Q15. Implement a function that takes in a string and reverses the order of the words in the string. For example, if the input is "hello world", the output should be >"world hello".
### Q16. Write a program that generates the first `n` Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. For example, if the input is 
### Q17. the output should be:
```Javascript
0 1 1 2 3 5

```
### Q18. Given an array of strings, write a function that returns the longest string in the array.
### Q19. Implement a function that takes in a string and checks if it is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same forward and backward). For example, if the input is "racecar", the output should be true.
### Q20. Write a program that generates the first n prime numbers. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself. For example, if the input is 5, the output should be:

```Javascript
2 3 5 7 11

```
### Q21. Given two arrays of numbers of the same length, write a function that returns an array with the sum of the corresponding elements of the two arrays. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3]` and `[4, 5, 6]`, the output should be `[5, 7, 9]`.
### Q22. Write a function that takes in a nested object and flattens it into a single-level object. For example, if the input is:

```Javascript
{
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  address: {
    street: "123 Main St",
    city: "Anytown",
    state: "CA",
    zip: "12345"
  },
  hobbies: ["reading", "running"],
  friends: [
    { name: "Jane", age: 28 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 35 }
  ]
}

```

The output should be:

```Javascript
{
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  "address.street": "123 Main St",
  "address.city": "Anytown",
  "address.state": "CA",
  "address.zip": "12345",
  hobbies: ["reading", "running"],
  "friends.0.name": "Jane",
  "friends.0.age": 28,
  "friends.1.name": "Bob",
  "friends.1.age": 35
}

```

Note that the keys of nested objects and arrays are concatenated with a dot (.) separator in the output object.

### Q32. Discuss your experience with testing in frontend development. What are some best practices
### Q33. Given a binary tree, write a function that prints the nodes in breadth-first search (BFS) order. For example, if the input tree is:

```Javascript
      1
    /   \
   2     3
  / \   / \
 4   5 6   7
```

The output should be: `1 2 3 4 5 6 7`

### Q34. Given a graph represented as an adjacency list, write a function that prints the nodes in depth-first search (DFS) order. For example, if the input graph is:

```Javascript
{
  1: [2, 3],
  2: [4],
  3: [4, 5],
  4: [6],
  5: [],
  6: []
}

```

The output should be: `1 2 4 6 3 5`

Note that in this example, there are multiple valid DFS orders, as there are multiple nodes with the same depth.
